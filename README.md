DigitalPiano
============

An embedded system, for a simple digital piano with 4 keys, was built in this project. This project was a laboratory exercise for the MOOC "UTAustinX: UT.6.01x Embedded Systems - Shape the World" (this MOOC was taught on edx.org). This project had the following major objectives: to learn about Digital-to-analog converter (DAC) conversion, to understand how digital data stored in a computer could be used to represent sounds and music, and to study how the DAC and interrupts can be used together to create sounds.

The C code for the project can be found in the Lab13_DAC folder. The main sub-routine is present in Lab13.c file. The system was divided into three main modules and the code for these 3 modules is present in DAC.c, Sound.c, and Piano.c. The program was run on the Tiva TM4C123G Launchpad microcontroller. The datasheet and manual of the Launchpad have been added to the project page as a reference guide. The Keil µVision Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was used for this project.
